    <h1><u>HTML 5 Structure Tags:</u></h1>
    <p>The new tag in HTML don't provide an advantge in in terms of styling your pages instead they provide their standard for descibing a structure of the page.</p>
    <p>This Standard makes it easier to build software that extracts infromation from the structured pages, so that it can be presented in an alternate way.</p>
    <p>The first part of the structure tag is:-</p>
    <p><b>Section tag: </b>The top Level structure element of a page is the html element.</p>
    <p>the next level is represented by head tag and body tag element</p>
    <p>in HTML 4 the ony element available for dividing the pages into different section is the div tag. However HTML 5 provides a number of other tags for representing different section of a page.</p>
    <p><b>Section tag: </b>The Section element is used to define a generic section of a document. A Section tag is epected to include a heading tag for that section.</p>
    <p><b>Header: </b>The header element is a container for element that generally appears at the tp of the page and are carrie across an entire site of the website. <br>You can add the header tagto other sectioning elements or even nest one Header within another. So the body tag can have ites own header an eaach of the sections can have thier individual header.</p>
    <p><b>Footer: </b>The footer element contains the text that has to be placed at th end of a pae. each of the secion can have thier own footer. <br>The footer section contains mostly the copyright information or the contact infomation of the of the page.</p>
    <p><b>nav: </b>HTML5 provides a nav tag that is supposed to contain a group of navigation links on he page.</p>
    <p><b>article: </b>The article element is another Sectioning element which is equivanlent t the section tag, with special semantic meaning. An article can be neted inside a section tag or a section tag can be nested inside an article tag. <br>Like the Section tag an article can also contain its own header footer and navigation.</p>
    <p><b>aside: </b>aside element when used inside an article they are supposed t represent the contents to represent the contents i.e, related to the surrounding articles but not a part of itself. An aside tag may contains a list of links for further reading or a list of terms used in the article and also some advertisement. <br>The aside tag can als be used outside an article to contain some information i.e, not directly relevent to the content of the main page.</p>
