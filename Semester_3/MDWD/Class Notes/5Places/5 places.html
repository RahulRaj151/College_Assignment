    <h1>My Five places I Like to Visit</h1>
    <p style="color: aliceblue;">A favourite place is something that is so easily relatable, since you know it so well, and have such fond memories in place. This makes it so easy when one has to write on this topic, because there is so much that can be expressed in an essay. It tells us about the place where a child feels secure and happy. An essay on ‘my favourite place’ for classes 1, 2, and 3 is relatively simple and expresses a comfortable place for the children. This place is where the child feels free and not captive. A place where they can be themselves can be anything, a playground, a school, a park, or maybe a sports arena.</p>
